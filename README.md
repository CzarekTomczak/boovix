Introduction
------------

Boovix is a program for cataloging movies located on a hard drive
or a network drive. This program is a successor of [the movies.js 
script](https://code.google.com/p/movies-js/). It provides more 
advanced features while still maintaining the simplicity of its 
predecessor.
