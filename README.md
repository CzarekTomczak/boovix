XBMC and other media centers are designed mainly for TV's and are best adjusted to be controlled via remote control. Thus user interface is very limited. The goal of the project is to take advantage of PC's features (like mouse and keyboard for example) and provide better user experience with more power features. At the same time allow some basic operations through remote control.
